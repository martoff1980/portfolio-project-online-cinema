# Online Cinema

An online cinema is a digital platform that allows users to select, watch, and purchase access to movies and other video materials via the internet. These services have become popular due to their
convenience, a wide selection of content, and the ability to personalize the user experience.

## Key Features of Online Cinema

## 1. **Authorization and Authentication**

<details>

- **User Registration**: \
  Users should be able to register using their email. After registration, an email is sent with a link to activate their account. If the user does not activate their account within 24 hours, the link becomes
  invalid. If the user fails to activate their account within 24 hours, they should have the option to enter their email to receive a new activation link, valid for another 24 hours. Use `celery-beat`
  to periodically delete expired activation tokens. \
  Ensure email uniqueness before registration.

- **Login and Logout**: \
  Provide a logout feature that deletes the user's JWT token, making it unusable for further logins.

- **Password Management**: \
  Users can change their password if they remember the old one by entering the old password and a new password. Users who forget their password can enter their email. If the email is registered and active,
  a reset link is sent, allowing them to set a new password without confirming the old one. Enforce password complexity validation.

- **JWT Token Management**: \
  Users receive a pair of JWT tokens (access and refresh) upon login. Users can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token with a shorter time-to-live (TTL).

- **User Groups**: \
  Create three user groups: \
  - **User**: Access to the basic user interface.
  - **Moderator**: In addition to catalog and user interface access, can manage movies on the site through the admin panel, view sales, etc.
  - **Admin**: Inherits all permissions from the above roles and can manage users, change group memberships, and manually activate accounts.

### Entities and Their Attributes

**UserGroupEnum (enum)** Enumeration of possible user groups (roles): \

- **USER**: A regular user with basic interface access.
- **MODERATOR**: A user who, in addition to the basic interface, can manage content (e.g., movies), view sales, and perform some administrative tasks.
- **ADMIN**: A user with extended rights. Can manage other users, change their groups, and manually activate accounts.

**GenderEnum (enum)** Enumeration for storing a user’s gender: \

- **MAN**
- **WOMAN**

This field is optional.

**UserGroup (user_groups table)** Stores user groups. \
**Attributes**: \

- `id`: Primary key (int).\
- `name`: Name of the group (USER, MODERATOR, ADMIN), unique field.

One-to-many: One UserGroup can be related to many User records.

**User (users table)** Represents registered users. \
**Attributes**: \
`id`: Primary key (int). \
`email`: User’s email, unique and required, used for login and identification. \
`hashed_password`: User’s password hash, stored securely (not in plain text). \ `is_active`: Boolean field indicating whether the account is activated. Initially `False`, becomes `True` after
activation. \
`created_at`: Timestamp of when the user was created. \
`updated_at`: Timestamp of the user’s last data update. \
`group_id`: Foreign key referencing `UserGroup`, indicating the group the user belongs to (User, Moderator, Admin).

`date_of_birth`: Date of birth, optional. `info`: A text field for a short bio or additional user info.

**ActivationToken (activation_tokens table)** A token for account activation, sent to the user’s email after registration. \
**Attributes**: \
`id`: Primary key (int). \
`user_id`: Foreign key referencing `users`. Unique, ensuring a one-to-one relationship with `User`. \
`token`: A unique token. expires_at: The token’s expiration time (24 hours after issuance).

**Tasks**:\

- Create a new `ActivationToken` upon registration.
- If the user does not activate their account within 24 hours, the token becomes invalid.
- Allow resending a new token if the old one expires. \
- Use `celery-beat` to periodically remove expired tokens.

**PasswordResetToken (password_reset_tokens table)** A token for resetting a forgotten password, sent to the user’s email upon request. \
**Attributes**: \

- `id`: Primary key (int). `user_id`: Foreign key referencing users. Unique, ensuring a one-to-one relationship with `User`. \
- `token`: A unique password reset token. \
- `expires_at`: The token’s expiration time.

**Tasks**: \

- On login, the user receives a pair of tokens: access and refresh.\
- When the access token expires, the user can use the refresh token to get a new access token. \
- On logout, the refresh token is deleted, preventing further use.

**Functional Requirements (Summary)**:

- Registration with an activation email.
- Account activation using the received token.
- Resending the activation token if the previous one expires.
- Use celery-beat to periodically remove expired tokens.
- Login that issues JWT tokens (access and refresh).
